# Ledbetter_CSCI2270_FinalProject

## Project Summary

This program is designed to act as a task list using a linked list as the running structure behind it. By using a linked list the program creates only as many data types the user gives it, maximizing memory in return. The user can either insert the new task by appending it to the end or traversing through the list to the position they desire. The program also incoporates a bubble sorting algorithm to sort the list from shortest to longest and vice versa by minutes. Once a task or the set of tasks has been completed, they can be deleted. This program stores information using a struct with the title being a string and the time in minutes as an int.
